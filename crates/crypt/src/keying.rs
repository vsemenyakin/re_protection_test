//! The `self-integrity` decode key: `getpagesize() ^ text_hash(.text) ^ SALT2`.
//!
//! `SALT2` is patched post-build by the `seal` tool to `page_size ^ text_hash ^ K`
//! (see `src/bin/seal.rs`), so the key resolves to `K` only for the exact code on
//! the intended hardware. There is no reference page size compiled in: the runtime
//! uses the *live* `getpagesize()`, and the seal tool takes the target page size as
//! a parameter -- so one compiled binary can be sealed for several page sizes.
//!
//! **The assembled key is never stored.** An earlier version derived the whole
//! key once and kept it in a single `static RUNTIME_KEY`, written by one `stlr`.
//! That is exactly the chokepoint the round-11 live-debugger attack broke on: a
//! hardware breakpoint on that one instruction read the entire key out of a
//! register. Here [`init`] stores only the two runtime-derived *shares* (the page
//! probe and the `.text` hash) in separate words, and [`key`] recombines them with
//! the patched `SALT2` **inline at every decode site**. There is no single global
//! equal to the key and no single instruction that assembles it; a passive reader
//! must recover shares from more than one place (or reverse a decode site under
//! MBA) rather than snapshot one `stlr`. The returned value is bit-identical to the
//! old `RUNTIME_KEY`, so behaviour (and the output oracle) is unchanged.
